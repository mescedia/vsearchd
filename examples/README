All examples require a running vsearchd instance. The servers default listening TCP interface is: 127.0.0.1:8282 

Before running these examples it is a good idea to add 'vsearchd-client.sh' to your PATH environment variable.
You will find it in the 'bin' folder below the projects root directory.

You will also have to ajust all absolte paths in all files below the 'req' and 'map' folders.

All examples target the projects test-pages on https://www.vsearchd.org/test-pages/. 
Alternatively you may ajust the project mapping files and use another location. The testpages (static HTML) resists in the 'www' folder 
below the projects root directory. 


To run an example change to the projects request folder 'req' and start the project:

	$ vsearchd-client ./run-project.xml

See servers output for details/results. 

There's currently not much documentation on this so you might browse the 'map' folder for details which contains one xml and a some xslt files.
These files basically contain the crawler instructions: where to go, what information to collect and how to process it.  

In the time of writing (v0.3.1) vsearchd provides some basic functionality and the examples listed offer some basic understanding 
of the crawlers capabilities.
You will have to add your own code and let your xslt-mappings interact with extension elements to receive adequate results. 
And this will be the point where things are getting interesting - promised.



Enjoy
